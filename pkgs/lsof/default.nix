    longDescription = ''
      lsof is a command meaning "list open files", which is used in many
      Unix-like systems to report a list of all open files and the processes
      that opened them.

      Features:
      - List all open files
      - Show processes that opened specific files
      - List files opened by specific processes
      - Display network connections (TCP, UDP sockets)
      - Show Unix domain sockets
      - Display open pipes
      - Show deleted files still held open
      - Filter by user, process, file descriptor type
      - Supports IPv4 and IPv6

      lsof is essential for system administration and debugging, helping to:
      - Find which process is using a file or directory
      - Identify network connections and listening ports
      - Troubleshoot "device or resource busy" errors
      - Detect deleted files still consuming disk space
